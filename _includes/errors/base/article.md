# Errors

Vero uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range mean success, codes in the `4xx` mean there was an error in the data passed to Vero's API (such as missing parameters) and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Vero's internal servers.
